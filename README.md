# Abstract:
How can I file my taxes? How does one go about buying a new home? How can one pay off their student loans? When it comes to entering the professional world, college students can often be overwhelmed by these types of financial topics that haven't been necessarily covered in many academic settings. LeopardCents is a web tool that unifies all the information that a student may need to know, so one can learn information about their financial decisions and how to start making investments towards their future. It works in tangent with the Student Service Center as a hub for teaching students and faculty about various financial topics, provides a handful of tools to help keep track of finances and allows student to meet with financial advisors to aid in making the best choices for them. Using a combination of VueJS, HTML/CSS and AWS Amplify, LeopardCents provides students with the tools they need to manage their finances during and after graduation.
